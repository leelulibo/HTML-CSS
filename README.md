# INTRODUCTION-TO-HTML 101

# HTML SYNTAX ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **HTML Structure:**
   - HTML is a language used to structure web pages.
   - Tags, enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, mark different elements.
   - Two types of tags: opening tags (<tag>) and closing tags (</tag>).


2. **HTML Elements:**
   - Elements are defined by tags and contain content.
   - Some elements require both opening and closing tags, while others do not.

3. **Markup Purpose:**
   - HTML markup gives meaning to content and helps computers understand it.
   - Acts as a bridge between the human and computer worlds.


4. **Nested HTML Elements:**
   - HTML elements can be nested within one another.
   - Entire HTML documents form a tree structure (DOM tree) with parents, children, and siblings.
   - DOM tree is important for CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility.


5. **Practical Example of Nesting:**
   - An article is an example of nested HTML elements.
   - Opening and closing tags define the article, headline, paragraphs, and emphasized text.
   - Proper nesting conveys meaning and affects the user experience.

6. **Closing Tags Importance:**
   - Forgetting to include closing tags is a common mistake in HTML.
   - Proper opening and closing of tags are crucial to conveying content meaning.


# HTML HEADLINES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Role of Headlines:**
   - Headlines, titles, and subheadings are crucial for dividing content into digestible chunks and conveying the page's structure.
   - On landing pages, headlines often serve as clickable titles leading to further information.

2. **HTML Headline Elements (h1 - h6):**
   - There are six headline elements in HTML: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
   - Each element has a distinct visual effect, conveying hierarchy and importance.
     
3. **Visual Hierarchy:**
   - h1 is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.
   - The visual presentation helps communicate the importance and hierarchy of the content.

4. **Choosing Headline Levels:**
   - Choosing the appropriate headline level is typically straightforward, starting with the opening tag and ending with the closing tag.
   - The challenge may arise in determining the most suitable level for a headline.

6. **Semantic Importance:**
   - Headline levels provide semantic meaning to browsers, distinguishing importance.
   - Consistent use of headline levels is crucial for accessibility, especially for screen reader users.


7. **Design Systems and Consistency:**
   - Design systems promote consistency and semantic success.
   - Teams may have predefined use cases for each headline level, contributing to a cohesive structure.


8. **Flexibility and Enhancement:**
   - No strict formula for using headline levels; flexibility is provided.
   - Leveraging all six levels can significantly enhance content structure and coherence.


# HTML LISTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Types of HTML Lists:
HTML supports three types of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists.

# Unordered Lists:
-Most commonly used type of list.
-Represented by the <ul> element.
-List items are enclosed in <li> elements.
-Each item in the list typically displays with a dot or marker.

# Ordered Lists:
-Similar to unordered lists but with a specific order to the items.
-Represented by the <ol> element.
-List items are also enclosed in <li> elements.
-Displays with numbered steps, indicating the order.

# Definition Lists:
-Used for creating lists resembling key-value pairs.
-Represented by the <dl> element.
-Terms or keys are enclosed in <dt> tags (definition term).
-Descriptions or values are enclosed in <dd> tags (definition description).
-Multiple descriptions for each term can be included.
-Terms and descriptions are placed side by side without additional wrapping.

# Styling and Structure:
-Indentation of list items for better code readability, although it doesn't affect webpage appearance.
-Default appearance of list markers determined by the browser, but can be styled using CSS

# HTML QUOTES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Block Quotes:**
   - Represented by the `<blockquote>` element.
   - Used for enclosing longer quotes, providing semantic meaning.
   - Typically includes the `<p>` element for paragraphs and the `<cite>` element for attribution.
   - Custom styling can be applied using CSS.

2. **Inline Quotes:**
   - Enclosed with the `<q>` element.
   - Used for shorter, inline quotes within text.
   - Automatically provides appropriate quote marks based on language conventions.
   - Comparable to other inline elements like `<strong>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<em>`.

3. **Block vs. Inline Context:**
   - Block-level elements (e.g., blockquotes) create separate blocks on the page.
   - Inline elements (e.g., `<q>`) are meant to wrap around inline text, serving a similar purpose.
   - Understanding the inherent nature of HTML elements is crucial before diving into layout and CSS considerations.

4. **Cite Element:**
   - Used to provide the source or reference of a quote.
   - Typically placed within or after the `<blockquote>` element.
   - Offers semantic value and aids in styling.

5. **Datetime Attribute:**
   - Used to specify dates and times in a machine-readable format.
   - Example: `<time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>`.
   - Follows a specific format (YYYY-MM-DD for dates, 24-hour clock format for times).
   
6. **Time Element:**
   - Used for indicating time in a standardized format.
   - Can include hours, minutes, seconds, fractions of a second, and time zone.
   - Combining date and time is possible using the `datetime` attribute.

7. **Machine-Readable Time:**
   - Preferred format includes the 24-hour clock, optional seconds, and time zone indication.
   - Example: `15:45 -05:00` represents 3:45 PM in a time zone five hours behind GMT.

8. **Combining Date and Time:**
   - Achieved using the `datetime` attribute with options to separate date and time using 'T' or space.
   - Various acceptable and correct formats exist, applicable to many programming languages.

   - Opening `<code>` tag before the code snippet and closing `</code>` tag afterward.
   - Results in styling changes with a monospaced font.
   - Default behavior is inline, remaining part of the sentence it's in.

2. **HTML Entities:**
   - Used to display reserved characters in HTML code.
   - Example: `&lt;` for less than sign (`<`), `&gt;` for greater than sign (`>`).
   - Prevents the browser from interpreting code as actual HTML tags.

3. **Using `<br>` Element:**
   - Addresses the need for line breaks in specific scenarios.
   - Unlike regular spaces and line breaks, `<br>` element forces the browser to display them.
   - Simple tag without opening or closing tags, indicating where a line break should occur.

4. **Using `<pre>` Element:**
   - Maintains formatting and spacing, displaying irregular spacing as intended.
   - Useful when precise spacing and line breaks are integral to the content's meaning.

   - Example: Wrapping HTML and CSS code in `<code>` element and further in `<pre>` element to preserve formatting and spacing.

6. **Integration of `<code>`, `<pre>`, and `<br>`:**
   - Illustrative example of combining these elements for effective content presentation.
   - Demonstrates their utility in conveying the structure and appearance of code and other content types.

7. **Versatility of Elements:**
   - `<code>`, `<pre>`, and `<br>` elements serve various purposes in enhancing the presentation and readability of content.
   - Handy for displaying code snippets, poems, and other formatted text on webpages.
  


  # HTML SUPERCRIPTS, SUBSCRIPTS, & SMALL TEXTX: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Subscripts and Superscripts:**
   - Subscripts are characters set below the normal baseline for text.
   - Superscripts are characters set above the normal baseline of text.
   - Commonly used in mathematical formulas, chemical equations, and footnotes.

2. **Using `<sub>` and `<sup>` Elements:**
   - To mark up subscripts, use the `<sub>` element.
   - To mark up superscripts, use the `<sup>` element.
   - Example: `<sub>2</sub>` for subscript and `<sup>2</sup>` for superscript.

3. **Handling Subscripts and Superscripts in HTML:**
   - Wrap the characters needing subscript or superscript in the respective `<sub>` or `<sup>` elements.
   - Adjusts the position and size of the characters accordingly.

4. **MathML for Complex Equations:**
   - For complex mathematical equations, consider using MathML, a specialized markup language for math.
   - More powerful than what HTML can provide for mathematical representation.

5. **Small Text with `<small>` Element:**
   - Used to mark text as fine print or less important but still necessary.
   - Example: Providing copyright information in the footer.
   - Not solely for adjusting text size; CSS can handle that aspect.

6. **Importance of `<small>` Element:**
   - `<small>` is used to convey that a certain passage of text has very little prominence.
   - Helpful for content like fine print at the bottom of a page regarding ownership or copyright information.
   - HTML element choice aligns with the semantic meaning of the content.

7. **HTML Elements for Typography:**
   - `<small>`, `<sub>`, and `<sup>` elements play a crucial role in refining typography and conveying the full meaning of content.
   - They aid in presenting details correctly, enhancing the overall visual and semantic aspects of the content.

   # HTML ATTRIBUTES: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Introduction to HTML Attributes:**
   - HTML elements have a basic version but gain additional capabilities through attributes.
   - Some attributes are specific to certain elements, while others work with multiple elements.

2. **Global Attributes:**
   - Four key global attributes are highlighted: "class" (for styling with CSS), "id" (unique on the entire HTML page), "lang" (specifies language), and "dir" (indicates text flow direction).

3. **Practical Use of Class and ID Attributes:**
   - "Class" is commonly used for styling, while "ID" is unique and valuable for JavaScript and targeted links.

4. **"content editable" Attribute:**
   - Allows visitors to edit webpage content, but page refresh reverts changes.
   - Backend development, typically in JavaScript, is required to capture and save edited content.

5. **Attributes for User Interaction:**
   - HTML attributes, like "content editable," enhance user interaction with the screen, keyboard, and assistive devices.
   - Many attributes provide browser APIs to JavaScript, improving the user experience.

6. **Additional Attributes - "lang" and "dir":**
   - "Lang" specifies content language using a short code, and "dir" indicates text flow direction.
   - Both are Global Attributes usable on any HTML element.

7. **Key Takeaway:**
   - Four essential Global Attributes are "class," "id," "lang," and "dir."
   - Comprehensive lists of Global Attributes can be found on MDM web docs.
   - These attributes enhance web page elements and improve user interaction.

# HTML  ARIA Roles: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Introduction to ARIA Roles:**
   - ARIA Roles are additional attributes added to HTML elements to enhance their meaning for assistive technologies like screen readers and braille displays.
   - The primary goal is to use proper HTML elements for content meaning, but compromises may be necessary for accessibility.

2. **Importance of ARIA Roles:**
   - ARIA Roles are crucial for making websites accessible to people with disabilities, ensuring compliance with laws in many places.
   - They play a vital role in providing essential information to assistive technologies, particularly in the context of complex interfaces in web applications.

3. **Example Demonstrating the Need for ARIA Roles:**
   - A CSS Grid experiment, placing each letter of the headline "hello world" in separate grid cells, creates a poor experience for screen reader users.
   - The accessibility tree treats each letter as a separate text container, spelling out the letters individually instead of reading the intended phrase.

4. **Using ARIA to Improve Accessibility:**
   - ARIA can be employed to enhance web accessibility by adding an ARIA label to specify the text that the screen reader should read.
   - Hiding individual letters using ARIA hidden attribute improves the screen reader experience without affecting the DOM tree.

5. **Understanding the Accessibility Tree:**
   - The accessibility tree, parallel to the DOM tree, is crucial for assistive devices like screen readers.
   - It represents the content structure, allowing assistive technologies to provide a better user experience.

6. **ARIA's Impact on Web Accessibility:**

   - They provide essential tools for conveying meaning to assistive technologies, improving the overall user experience.
   - ARIA is particularly valuable when working with complex interfaces or teams struggling with semantic HTML.


# FORMATTING HTML: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Whitespace Handling in HTML:**
   - HTML generally ignores spaces, tabs, and line breaks, except in specific cases like `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<textarea>`, or when modified by CSS.
   - Extra spaces and indentations usually don't matter to browsers and are often ignored.

2. **Comments in HTML:**
   - Comments in HTML are added using `<!--` at the start and `-->` at the end.
   - Browsers disregard comments, but code editors may display them in a grayed-out fashion, enhancing code readability and identifying commented sections.

3. **Uppercase vs. Lowercase in HTML:**
   - In the early days, HTML elements were often capitalized, but modern practices favor lowercase for consistency.
   - Browser support is not affected by the case, and either uppercase or lowercase HTML is handled well.

4. **Length of HTML Elements:**
   - Early HTML elements were often abbreviated to optimize file size due to limited computer resources.
   - As technology advanced, newer elements favored complete words for improved readability and understandability.
   - The length of an HTML element can provide a clue about its historical context and age.

5. **Self-Closing Elements in HTML:**
   - While most HTML elements have both opening and closing tags, newer elements always include both.
   - Older elements, like `<img>`, lacked closing tags initially. Adding a slash at the end (`<img />`) became a best practice, but it is less emphasized in recent years.
   - Browsers accommodate various formatting options for self-closing elements, allowing flexibility in writing HTML. The choice of using a closing slash is up to personal preference.
  

# UNUSUAL CHARACTERS: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Handling <, >, and &:**
   - In HTML, the symbols `<`, `>`, and `&` are significant characters.
   - If written with spaces around them, they appear as regular content; however, if resembling an HTML element, they might disappear as the browser assumes they are part of HTML code.

2. **Character Entities in HTML:**
   - Character entities in HTML are represented as an ampersand, a short code, and a semicolon.
   - These entities replace symbols like `<` and `>` to ensure proper display in HTML content.
   - The W3C provides a reference chart for character entities, useful for typing characters not available on the keyboard.

3. **Non-Breaking Spaces in HTML:**
   - Non-breaking spaces have a unique role in preventing line breaks between words.
   - Using `&nbsp;` in HTML ensures that the browser keeps words together on the same line, useful for names like "Lebron James."
   - Non-breaking spaces also enable creating multiple spaces between words, unlike regular spaces that may be ignored by the browser.

4. **Usefulness of Character Entities:**
   - Character entities, including non-breaking spaces, ensure specific characters are displayed as intended on webpages.
   - They offer a solution for handling characters not easily accessible on the keyboard, providing an alternative to copying and pasting or learning keyboard commands.
     
  
# HTML LINKS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Introduction to Web Links:**
   - Web links are now commonplace, encountered throughout online experiences in navigation bars, menus, teaser cards, and clickable article titles.
   - The concept of linking, hypertext, and hypermedia has been integral to computing innovation since the 1960s, leading to the birth of the web.

2. **Creating Links with the A Element:**
   - To create a link, the HTML A element (anchor) is used.
   - The A element requires an href attribute containing a URL enclosed in quotes, specifying the destination of the link.
   - Text, images, or both can be placed between the opening and closing A tags to make them clickable.

3. **Linking Text, Images, or Complex Elements:**
   - The A element, by default, is inline and can be placed within paragraphs or any other text.
   - Links are not limited to text; they can also wrap around images or more complex elements, enabling the creation of linked groups of elements.

4. **Absolute URLs for Linking:**
   - URLs for linking can be versatile, including the entire URL when linking to another website or specific web page.
   - Absolute URLs point precisely to a location on the web and must include the HTTP or HTTPS part, which stands for Hypertext Transport Protocol.

5. **Importance of HTTPS in URLs:**
   - HTTPS, where the "S" stands for Secure, is recommended for enhanced security in modern web addresses.
   - While modern browsers automatically add HTTPS://, developers and content creators need to include it when manually creating links.

6. **Significance of HTTP and HTTPS:**
   - HTTP and HTTPS are protocols defining rules for web communication.
   - HTTPS is considered more secure, and its inclusion in URLs is crucial when creating links.

7. **Historical Perspective on Link Creation:**
   - The creation of links, utilizing absolute URLs and protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, was one of the most significant inventions in the early days of the web.
  

   # HTML URL PATHWAYS:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Absolute and Relative URLs:**
   - Absolute URLs point to a specific location on the web and include the full domain, while relative URLs are based on the current file's location.
   - When working locally or on different servers, using relative URLs allows flexibility in directing links to local copies or testing servers.

2. **Creating Relative URLs:**
   - Relative URLs are essential not just for linking (A element) but also for referencing image files, video files, CSS, JavaScript files, or any other files with specified paths.
   - Understanding file organization is crucial; slashes in a URL indicate navigating the file structure.

3. **Forming Relative URLs:**
   - To create a relative URL, omit the domain name and include the initial slash at the beginning to start from the root level.
   - Alternatively, write the path relative to the file where the link is written.

4. **Example of Relative URL Creation:**
   - Given the file styles.css in a directory named CSS, to link to logo.gif in the images folder, two options are available:
     - /images/logo.gif (relative to the root level)
     - ../images/logo.gif (relative to the current file's location, going up one level).

5. **Understanding URLs with Folders:**
   - In web development, a URL like http://www.awesomedogs.com/people looks for an index.html file inside the people folder.
   - Creating folders and using index.html allows for a clean URL structure but applies only to HTML files, not images or CSS.

6. **Trailing Slash in URLs:**
   - Whether a trailing slash is included or not in a URL doesn't matter; both versions lead to the same destination.

7. **Considerations for Well-Structured URLs:**
   - Crafting well-structured and elegant URLs is essential for user experience and search engine results.
   - Careful consideration of URL impact, especially when using relative URLs, is crucial for projects that move from server to server.

8. **Summary of URL Types:**
   - URLs can be either relative or absolute.
   - Relative URLs are based on the current file's location, while absolute URLs start from the root of the website.
   - Using folders and index.html files can help create clean and user-friendly URLs in web development.
